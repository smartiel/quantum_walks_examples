    "# Quantum Search on an hypercube\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will program a simple Quantum Walk that seaches for marked elements in an hypercube.\n",
    "The implementation will be done using `myqlm` which is a collection of tools to program and execute quantum programs. The python library provided by `myqlm` is called `qat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An hypercube of dimension $n$ is graph $G=(V, E)$ defined as follows: vertices are bitstrings of fixed length $n$ and two bitstrings are neighbors if and only if they only differ in a single position.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally:\n",
    " - $V = \\{0, 1\\}^n$\n",
    " - $\\forall x, y \\in V, \\{x, y\\} \\in E \\Leftrightarrow |x\\oplus y| = 1$\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "## The ingredients\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the structure of a Quantum Walk based search that looks for elements in a subset $M\\subseteq X$ marked by some oracle $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory**: We will need a quantum state that represents edges of our graphs (that is, pairs of vertices). In our case this means that we will need two quantum registers of length $n$, each storing one extremity of an edge, like so: $|x\\rangle |y\\rangle $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We note $|p_x\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d(x)}} \\sum_{y\\in \\mathcal{N}_x} |y\\rangle$, that is the uniform superposition of neighbors of vertex $x$ in $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pseudo-code**: The search goes as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) prepare the memory in the state $|U\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|X|}}\\sum_x |x\\rangle|p_x\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Repeat enough time the following amplification:\n",
    "* reflect through $|B\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|X| - |M|}}\\sum_{x, P(x)=0} |x\\rangle|p_x\\rangle$\n",
    "* reflect through the uniform distribution $|U\\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|X|}}\\sum_{x} |x\\rangle|p_x\\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this we will need the following subroutines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a subroutine called $U$ that, given some vertex, prepares a superposition of its neighbors in $G$:\n",
    "$$ U:|x\\rangle|0\\rangle \\mapsto |x\\rangle|p_x\\rangle $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- a subroutine implementing $U_f$\n",
    "\n",
    "- an implementation of the $W(G)$ unitary operator (see details below)\n",
    "\n",
    "- a Quantum Phase Estimation of $W(G)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing $U$ for an hypergraph\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement $U$, we need to program a quantum circuit that takes a bitstring in a register and creates a uniform superposition of all the bitstrings obtained by flipping a single bit of this bitstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following piece of code is a single routine that takes a register in state $|0\\rangle$ and creates a uniform superposition of bitstring of Hamming weight $1$ (i.e bitstrings obtained by take the all zero bitstring and flipping a single bit).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so by successively splitting $|0...0\\rangle$ into $|0...0\\rangle$ and $|h_i\\rangle$ where $h_i$ is a bitstring of Hamming weight $1$."
